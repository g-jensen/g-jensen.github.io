--><p>The latest feature that I implemented in my math language is the ability to define a symbol and store
a value in that symbol. To implement this, I first needed to define a scope. To do this, I made the <code>evaluate()</code>
function take in a scope as a parameter for every node. In this case, a scope is simply a map of strings to values.
I also had to create a special type of node: a <code>SymbolExpressionNode</code>. A <code>SymbolExpressionNode</code> has a name, and when
<code>evaluate()</code> is called on a <code>SymbolsExpressionNode</code>, it returns the value corresponding its name in the
scope map. With a working scope, I could now define symbols within that scope. Whenever the interpreter came across
<code>def</code>, it would add the next two parameters as a key and value respectively to the scope map. For example,
<code>def A 5</code> would add the key value pair <code>(A,5)</code> to the scope map. This way I can pass in the updated scope
map to every <code>evaluate()</code> call, and it will evaluate A to 5.</p></div></div></body>
