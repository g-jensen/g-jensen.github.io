--><p>My latest task for my TicTacToe project is to implement SQL persistence (a database).
SQL is a relational database management system. I have previously implemented a file persistence, and
since I adhered to the Open-Closed principle, adding SQL functionality is easy. I already have an interface
called <code>Database</code> and type called <code>FileDatabase</code> which implements the <code>initialize</code>, <code>fetch-all-games</code>, <code>update-game</code>, and
<code>delete-game</code> functions. So all I have to do is make another type called <code>SQLDatabase</code> and implement those function
and everything works perfectly. The fact that I did not have to modify existing code to add this feature
shows that I was adhering to the Open-Closed principle because my code was open for extension and closed for modification.</p></div></div></body>
