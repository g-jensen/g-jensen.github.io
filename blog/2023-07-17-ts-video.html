--><p>Besides practicing some katas, all I had to do today was make my Traveling Salesman kata video. For my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGAPlWsKqro">last kata video</a> I did a voice-over,
which was the most time-consuming part. For this one I did not do a voice-over which made things pretty simple. All I had to do was record myself
doing the Kata relatively flawlessly. If there were any typos during the kata, I just cut them out in Adobe Rush. I also had
to make a separate recording of me using the Traveling Salesman GUI that I made, which I then appended to the
recording of the kata. After that I just looked up some royalty free music on Youtube to add to the Kata and I was done.</p></div></div></body>
