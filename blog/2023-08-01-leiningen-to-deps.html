--><p>Thus far, I've been using <a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a> for all of my Clojure projects, but I recently
had to change that due to a new story requirement. With my finished Java HTTP server, I need to convert
that to a <code>.jar</code> and import it into my Clojure TicTacToe program to make a TicTacToe web server application.
The problem is, Leiningen doesn't have a way to import local jar files. So I had to convert my project to <code>deps</code>.</p><p><a href="https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli">Deps</a> is Clojure's default project structure and dependency manager. It also happens to make it very easy
to import local jar files. To convert my project to deps, I needed to place Leiningen's <code>project.clj</code> with
Clojure's <code>deps.edn</code>. The <code>deps.edn</code> file has a different structure to <code>project.clj</code>, but the conversions are
relatively one-to-one.</p><p>With my new <code>dep.edn</code> file working, I can now reload my project as a Clojure Deps project and everything (including Intellij)
is working.</p></div></div></body>
