--><p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=15">Project Euler #15</a> asks: How many distinct Lattice Paths in a 20x20 grid from
the top left to the bottom right are there?</p><p>The example they show is of a 2x2 grid, which has 6 distinct paths.</p><p>To solve this, one might try to walk through every possible path and keep track of the number of paths counted.</p><p>But there is actually a pretty simple formula for the calculation asked for in the problem.</p><p>If we label the different possible directions a, b, c, and d, it is a little easier to see.</p><p><img alt="lattice-label.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g-jensen/blog/main/assets/lattice.png" /></p><p>We want to know the different ways that we can arrange a, b, c, and d. Which is just the permutations. So the formula
must be <code>(2n)!</code> right?</p><p>Almost. We actually double-count a lot while going through the permutations of [a b c d]. For example, the permutation
[a b c d] is the same as [a b d c] because <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> both go to the right.</p><p>So we really want all the permutations of [a b c d] where <code>a</code> comes before <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> comes before <code>d</code>. To do
this, we must divide by <code>(n!)^2</code> (one <code>n!</code> for the <code>a-b</code> rule and one for the <code>c-d</code> rule).</p></div></div></body>
