--><p>In a <a href="https://gregjensen.dev/blog/2023/06/29/tictactoe-menu.html">previous post</a>, I showed my menu system
for my TicTacToe program that I am creating. My newest story requires me to allow the user to select
any board size greater than two. I chose to go about this by creating a counter corresponding with the
desired board size that the user can either increment or decrement. But my current system doesn't easily
allow for the creation of a counter, so what should I do? Well, since I'm using maps and
multimethods to dispatch the <code>ui-components</code>, I simply add <code>:type :menu</code> to my previously made components and
<code>:type :counter</code> to my new component. This way I can make a multimethod, <code>draw-components</code> that dispatches
based on <code>:type</code>. I can the use my previous method of drawing menus and put it under the <code>:menu</code> method
and draw the counter with the <code>:counter</code> implementation of the multimethod. Since the counter also updates
the state differently to the regular menu, I also created a multimethod called <code>update-ui</code> that also dispatched
based on <code>:type</code>. This way I can update and draw any type of ui component.</p></div></div></body>
