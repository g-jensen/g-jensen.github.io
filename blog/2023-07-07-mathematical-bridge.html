is made completely out of straight pieces of wood.</p><p>A popular fable told about the bridge is that it was built by Issac Newton. This is of course impossible,
because Newton died in 1727. The fable states that the bridge was originally built without any nuts or bolts and
one day some students wanted to figure out how Newton did it. The students took the bridge apart and tried
to rebuild it but could not figure out how to put it back together which is why nuts and bolts are seen today.</p></div></div></body>
