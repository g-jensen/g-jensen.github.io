--><p>In a two-dimensional 3x3 TicTacToe game, the first player, <code>x</code>, will always have the advantage. Although,
going first does not guarantee a win. If both players play the best moves in TicTacToe, the game ends in
a draw. This is different from a three-dimensional 3x3x3 TicTacToe game, where going first actually
always guarantees a win in at most four moves when played optimally. The strategy as <code>x</code> is to always go in the very center
of the cube as the first move. Then, for <code>x</code>'s second move, pick a tile such that <code>o</code> must block without
making two in a row. After this, <code>x</code> can now make a fork (two different paths to win) which makes the subsequent
move result in a win. Of course, if <code>o</code> does not ever block the win will come earlier, but this is assuming
each player plays the best move.</p></div></div></body>
