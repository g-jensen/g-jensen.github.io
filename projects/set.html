            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)">Set</a> is a card game with 81 unique cards that can be played alone or with friends. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Here's a <a href="../set/index.html">link</a> to an online version of Set that I made in Clojure(Script).
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>How To Play</h2>
            Each card has four attributes with three options each: color (red, green, purple), count (1, 2, 3), shape (oval, diamond, squiggle), and shade (open, striped, open).
            <br>
            <br>
            Here is an example of 3 cards:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="../set/cards/red-one-oval-open.png" alt="red-one-oval-open">
                <img src="../set/cards/green-two-diamond-striped.png" alt="green-two-diamond-striped">
                <img src="../set/cards/purple-three-squiggle-solid.png" alt="purple-three-squiggle-solid">
            </div>
            <br>
            In the game of Set, 12 cards are delt in front of everyone and the goal is to find a "set". A set is defined as 3 cards where each of the four attributes are either all the same or all different for each card. For instance, the three cards above make a set because each of the attributes are all different.
            <br>
            <br>
            The following is NOT a set:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="../set/cards/purple-two-diamond-solid.png" alt="purple-two-diamond-solid">
                <img src="../set/cards/green-one-squiggle-striped.png" alt="green-one-squiggle-striped">
                <img src="../set/cards/green-three-oval-open.png" alt="green-three-oval-open">
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            because the color is not all the same or all different (two are the same while one is different).
            <br>
            <br>
            Here is another example that IS a set:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="../set/cards/red-one-diamond-solid.png" alt="red-one-diamond-solid">
                <img src="../set/cards/red-two-diamond-solid.png" alt="red-two-diamond-solid">
                <img src="../set/cards/red-three-diamond-solid.png" alt="red-three-diamond-solid">
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a set because the color is all the same, the count is all different, the shape is all the same, and the shade is all the same.
            <br>
